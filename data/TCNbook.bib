Of these methods, one that uses a simpler geographic scaling method based on energy-dependent attenuation of muons in the atmosphere appears to fit calibration data better than a more complicated one that uses the results of a global particle transport model to estimate geographic variation in the surface muon energy spectrum. Second, I show that although highly simplified and computationally much cheaper exponential function approximations for subsurface production rates are not globally adequate for accurate production rate estimates at arbitrary location and depth, they can be used with acceptable accuracy for many exposure-dating and erosion-rate-estimation applications.},

  abstract = {Models of the production of cosmogenic nuclides typically incorporate an adjustable production rate parameter that is scaled for variations in production with latitude and altitude. In practice, this production rate parameter is set by calibration of the model using cosmogenic nuclide data from sites with independent age constraints. In this paper, we describe a calibration procedure developed during the Cosmic-Ray Produced Nuclide Systematics on Earth (CRONUS-Earth) project and its application to an extensive data set that included both new CRONUS-Earth samples and samples from previously published studies. We considered seven frameworks for elevation and latitude scaling and five commonly used cosmogenic nuclides, 3He, 10Be, 14C, 26Al, and 36Cl. In general, the results show that the calibrated production rates fail statistical tests of goodness-of-fit. One conclusion from the calibration results is that two newly developed scaling frameworks and the widely used Lal scaling framework provide qualitatively similar fits to the data, while neutron-monitor based scaling frameworks have much poorer fit to the data. To further test the fitted models, we computed site ages for a number of secondary sites not included in the primary calibration data set. The root-mean-square percent differences between the median computed ages for these secondary sites and independent ages range from 7.1\% to 27.1\%, differences that are much larger than the typical uncertainties in the site ages. The results indicate that there are substantial unresolved difficulties in modeling cosmogenic nuclide production and the calibration of production rates.},

  abstract = {The cosmogenic nuclide exposure history method is undergoing major developments in analytical, theoretical, and applied areas. The capability to routinely measure low concentrations of stable and radioactive cosmogenic nuclides has led to new methods for addressing long-standing geologic questions and has provided insights into rates and styles of surficial processes. The different physical and chemical properties of the six most widely used nuclides: 3He, 10Be, 14C, 21Ne, 26Al, and 36Cl, make it possible to apply the surface exposure dating methods on rock surfaces of virtually any lithology at any latitude and altitude, for exposures ranging from 102 to 107 years. The terrestrial in situ cosmogenic nuclide method is beginning to revolutionize the manner in which we study landscape evolution. Single or multiple nuclides can be measured in a single rock surface to obtain erosion rates on boulder and bedrock surfaces, fluvial incision rates, denudation rates of individual landforms or entire drainage basins, burial histories of rock surfaces and sediment, scarp retreat, fault slip rates, paleoseismology, and paleoaltimetry. Ages of climatic variations recorded by moraine and alluvium sediments are being directly determined. Advances in our understanding of how cosmic radiation interacts with the geomagnetic field and atmosphere will improve numerical simulations of cosmic-ray interactions over any exposure duration and complement additional empirical measurements of nuclide production rates. The total uncertainty in the exposure ages is continually improving. This article presents the theory necessary for interpreting cosmogenic nuclide data, reviews estimates of parameters, describes strategies and practical considerations in field applications, and assesses sources of error in interpreting cosmogenic nuclide measurements.

  abstract = {The well-preserved glacial record in Argentine Patagonia offers a \textasciitilde{} 1 Ma archive of terrestrial climate extremes in southern South America. These glacial deposits remain largely undated beyond the range of radiocarbon dating at ca. 40 ka. Dating old glacial deposits ({$>$} several 105 a) by cosmogenic surface exposure methods is problematic because of the uncertainty in moraine degradation and boulder erosion rates. Here, we show that cobbles on outwash terraces can reliably date 'old' glacial deposits in the Lago Pueyrred\'on valley, 47.5\textdegree{} S, Argentina. Favorable environmental conditions (e.g., aridity and strong winds) have enabled continuous surface exposure of cobbles and preservation of outwash terraces. The data demonstrate that nuclide inheritance is negligible and we therefore use the oldest surface cobbles to date the deposit. 10Be concentrations in outwash cobbles reveal a major glacial advance at ca. 260 ka, concurrent with Marine Isotope Stage 8 (MIS 8) and dust peaks in Antarctic ice cores. A 10Be concentration depth-profile in the outwash terrace supports the age and suggests a low terrace erosion rate of ca. 0.5 mm ka- 1. We compare these data to exposure ages obtained from associated moraines and find that surface boulders underestimate the age of the glaciation by \textasciitilde{} 100 ka; thus the oldest boulders in this area do not date closely moraine deposition. The 10Be concentration in moraine cobbles help to constrain moraine degradation rates. These data together with constraints from measured 26Al/10Be ratios suggest that all moraine boulders were likely exhumed after original deposition. We determine the local Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) occurred at \textasciitilde{} 27-25 ka, consistent with the maximum LGM in other parts of Patagonia. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in rocks and sediments are widely used to study the evolution of landscapes that have experienced complex exposure/burial and erosion histories. Measured nuclide concentrations are typically compared with those obtained by time-integrating hypothetical histories of erosion and exposure. The presence of erosion, in particular, complicates the time-integration of nuclide concentrations, because erosion removes nuclides while at the same time increasing their production in new material advected towards the surface. This relative movement between sample and surface calls for a choice between a Eulerian reference frame, in which the integration point is fixed relative to the surface, or a Lagrangian reference frame, in which the integration point rides the sample on its way to the surface. The equations developed in the early 1990s to compute changes in cosmogenic nuclide inventories for geological settings undergoing steady erosion are now used routinely, but they are not directly applicable for time-integrating nuclide concentrations related to variable exposure and erosional transience. In this study, we lay out the fundamental equations associated with the Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches to compute cosmogenic nuclide concentrations under the influence of variable exposure and erosion, and discuss the pros and cons of the two approaches for different scenarios. We then extend our analysis to unconsolidated sediment/soil profiles by outlining a new and flexible approach to modelling cosmogenic-nuclide depth profiles that include depth-dependent mixing processes, combined with variable erosion rates and complex exposure/burial histories. We conclude with a few guidelines for reporting the steps involved with computing cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in geological settings influenced by variable exposure and erosional transience.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The rate at which low-lying sandy areas in temperate regions, such as the Campine Plateau (NE Belgium), have been eroding during the Quaternary is a matter of debate. Current knowledge on the average pace of landscape evolution in the Campine area is largely based on geological inferences and modern analogies. We performed a Bayesian inversion of an in situ-produced 10Be concentration depth profile to infer the average long-term erosion rate together with two other parameters: the surface exposure age and the inherited 10Be concentration. Compared to the latest advances in probabilistic inversion of cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) data, our approach has the following two innovative components: it (1) uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and (2) accounts (under certain assumptions) for the contribution of model errors to posterior uncertainty. To investigate to what extent our approach differs from the state of the art in practice, a comparison against the Bayesian inversion method implemented in the CRONUScalc program is made. Both approaches identify similar maximum a posteriori (MAP) parameter values, but posterior parameter and predictive uncertainty derived using the method taken in CRONUScalc is moderately underestimated. A simple way for producing more consistent uncertainty estimates with the CRONUScalc-like method in the presence of model errors is therefore suggested. Our inferred erosion rate of 39 {$\pm$} 8. 9 mm kyr-1 (1{$\sigma$}) is relatively large in comparison with landforms that erode under comparable (paleo-)climates elsewhere in the world. We evaluate this value in the light of the erodibility of the substrate and sudden base level lowering during the Middle Pleistocene. A denser sampling scheme of a two-nuclide concentration depth profile would allow for better inferred erosion rate resolution, and including more uncertain parameters in the MCMC inversion.},

  abstract = {Several models have been proposed for scaling in situ cosmogenic nuclide production rates from the relatively few sites where they have been measured to other sites of interest. Two main types of models are recognized: (1) those based on data from nuclear disintegrations in photographic emulsions combined with various neutron detectors, and (2) those based largely on neutron monitor data. However, stubborn discrepancies between these model types have led to frequent confusion when calculating surface exposure ages from production rates derived from the models. To help resolve these discrepancies and identify the sources of potential biases in each model, we have developed a new scaling model based on analytical approximations to modeled fluxes of the main atmospheric cosmic-ray particles responsible for in situ cosmogenic nuclide production. Both the analytical formulations and the Monte Carlo model fluxes on which they are based agree well with measured atmospheric fluxes of neutrons, protons, and muons, indicating they can serve as a robust estimate of the atmospheric cosmic-ray flux based on first principles. We are also using updated records for quantifying temporal and spatial variability in geomagnetic and solar modulation effects on the fluxes. A key advantage of this new model (herein termed LSD) over previous Monte Carlo models of cosmogenic nuclide production is that it allows for faster estimation of scaling factors based on time-varying geomagnetic and solar inputs. Comparing scaling predictions derived from the LSD model with those of previously published models suggest potential sources of bias in the latter can be largely attributed to two factors: different energy responses of the secondary neutron detectors used in developing the models, and different geomagnetic parameterizations.Given that the LSD model generates flux spectra for each cosmic-ray particle of interest, it is also relatively straightforward to generate nuclide-specific scaling factors based on recently updated neutron and proton excitation functions (probability of nuclide production in a given nuclear reaction as a function of energy) for commonly measured in situ cosmogenic nuclides. Such scaling factors reflect the influence of the energy distribution of the flux folded with the relevant excitation functions. Resulting scaling factors indicate 3He shows the strongest positive deviation from the flux-based scaling, while 14C exhibits a negative deviation. These results are consistent with a recent Monte Carlo-based study using a different cosmic-ray physics code package but the same excitation functions. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Investigation of Holocene extents of mountain glaciers along with the related naturally-driven climate conditions helps improve our understanding of glacier sensitivity to ongoing climate change. Here, we present the first Holocene glacial chronology in the Mont-Blanc massif (Argenti\`ere glacier) in the French Alps, based on 25 in situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be dates of moraines and glacial bedrocks. The obtained ages from mapped sequences of moraines at three locations reveal that the glacier retreated from its Lateglacial extent and oscillated several times between {$\sim$}11.7 ka and {$\sim$}10.4 ka, i.e. during the Younger Dryas/Early Holocene (YD/EH) transition, before substantially retreating at {$\sim$}10.4 ka. Climate conditions corresponding to the past extents of Argenti\`ere glacier during the YD/EH transition ({$\sim$}11 ka) and the Little Ice Age (LIA) were modelled with two different approaches: by determining summer temperature differences from reconstructed ELA-rises and by using a Positive Degree Day (PDD) mass-balance model. The ELA-rise reconstructions yield a possible range of temperatures for the YD/EH transition that were lower by between 3.0 and 4.8 \textdegree C compared to the year 2008, depending on the choice of the ELA sensitivity to temperature. The results from the PDD model indicate temperatures lower by {$\sim$}3.6\textendash 5.5 \textdegree C during the YD/EH transition than during the 1979\textendash 2002 period. For the LIA, our findings highlight the role of local precipitation changes, superimposed on the dominant temperature signal, in the detailed evolution of the glacier. Overall, this study highlights the challenge that remains in accurately inferring paleoclimate conditions from past glacier extents.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, in situ-produced cosmogenic nuclides have revolutionised the study of landscape evolution. In particular, numerous studies have demonstrated that, in active tectonic settings, cosmicrayexposure dating of deformed or displaced geomorphic features makes it possible to quantify long-term deformation rates. In western European countries, erosion due to climatically driven processes and human activities is probably the factor that most limits the accuracy of exposure ages and landscape modification rates. In this study, we present the results of a depth-profiling technique applied to alluvial terraces located along the Rh\^one and the Moyenne Durance rivers. The expected decrease with depth of the measured 10Be concentrations has been modelled using a {$\chi$}2 inversion method in order to constrain the exposure history of the alluvial sediments. The results suggest that: (1) over the Quaternary, the local surface erosionrates including both regional uplift and climatically driven processes acting on landforms are on the order of 30 m/Myr in southeastern France, and (2) providing a fairly good bracketing of the exposure age, the modelled abandonment age of alluvial terraces affected by the Moyenne Durance Fault allows estimating incision rates, comparing the alluvial terrace elevations with topographic river profiles, and a minimum vertical slip rate value of roughly 0.02 mm/yr for the southern segment of the Moyenne Durance Fault.},

  abstract = {The cosmic ray flux increases at higher altitude as air pressure and the shielding effect of the atmosphere decrease. Altitude-dependent scaling factors are required to compensate for this effect in calculating cosmic ray exposure ages. Scaling factors in current use assume a uniform relationship between altitude and atmospheric pressure over the Earth's surface. This masks regional differences in mean annual pressure and spatial variation in cosmogenic isotope production rates. Outside Antarctica, air pressures over land depart from the standard atmosphere by {$\pm$}4.4 hPa (1{$\sigma$}) near sea level, corresponding to offsets of {$\pm$}3\textendash 4\% in isotope production rates. Greater offsets occur in regions of persistent high and low pressure such as Siberia and Iceland, where conventional scaling factors predict production rates in error by {$\pm$}10\%. The largest deviations occur over Antarctica where ground level pressures are 20\textendash 40 hPa lower than the standard atmosphere at all altitudes. Isotope production rates in Antarctica are therefore 25\textendash 30\% higher than values calculated by scaling Northern Hemisphere production rates with conventional scaling factors. Exposure ages of old Antarctic surfaces, especially those based on cosmogenic radionuclides at levels close to saturation, may be millions of years younger than published estimates.},

  abstract = {ERA-40 is a re-analysis of meteorological observations from September 1957 to August 2002 produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in collaboration with many institutions. The observing system changed considerably over this re-analysis period, with assimilable data provided by a succession of satellite-borne instruments from the 1970s onwards, supplemented by increasing numbers of observations from aircraft, ocean-buoys and other surface platforms, but with a declining number of radiosonde ascents since the late 1980s. The observations used in ERA-40 were accumulated from many sources. The first part of this paper describes the data acquisition and the principal changes in data type and coverage over the period. It also describes the data assimilation system used for ERA-40. This benefited from many of the changes introduced into operational forecasting since the mid-1990s, when the systems used for the 15-year ECMWF re-analysis (ERA-15) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) re-analysis were implemented. Several of the improvements are discussed. General aspects of the production of the analyses are also summarized. A number of results indicative of the overall performance of the data assimilation system, and implicitly of the observing system, are presented and discussed. The comparison of background (short-range) forecasts and analyses with observations, the consistency of the global mass budget, the magnitude of differences between analysis and background fields and the accuracy of medium-range forecasts run from the ERA-40 analyses are illustrated. Several results demonstrate the marked improvement that was made to the observing system for the southern hemisphere in the 1970s, particularly towards the end of the decade. In contrast, the synoptic quality of the analysis for the northern hemisphere is sufficient to provide forecasts that remain skilful well into the medium range for all years. Two particular problems are also examined: excessive precipitation over tropical oceans and a too strong Brewer-Dobson circulation, both of which are pronounced in later years. Several other aspects of the quality of the re-analyses revealed by monitoring and validation studies are summarized. Expectations that the 'second-generation' ERA-40 re-analysis would provide products that are better than those from the first-generation ERA-15 and NCEP/NCAR re-analyses are found to have been met in most cases. \textcopyright{} Royal Meteorological Society, 2005.},

  abstract = {The study of a sample of riversediment enables the determination of spatially averaged denudation rates that provide an exceptional perspective on erosion and weathering processes that have taken place within a landscape. These measurements are done with in-situ produced cosmogenicnuclides (e.g. 10Be, 26Al), mostly in quartz from alluvial sediment. Cosmogenicnuclides are produced when secondary cosmic rays interact with the very uppermost layer of the Earth's surface. They are produced within a characteristic depth scale of about 1 m, which means that the measured concentrations record an integrated denudation history while material passed through this depth interval. Depending on the denudation rate the resulting integration time scales are 103 to 105 years, and one obtains a robust long-term estimate of natural denudation that is relatively insensitive to short-term changes. The last 10 years have seen significant research activity using these methods, and an array of fascinating tectono-geomorphologic and geochemical insights are emerging. Amongst these is the ability to identify the physical and chemical processes with which a landscape responds to tectonic activity or climate change. A compilation of world-wide denudation rates in non-glaciated areas, that however, does not yet include some of the world's most active mountain belts, has resulted in the following findings, some of which have been unexpected: (1) No obvious relationship between precipitation or mean annual temperature and total denudation is apparent. (2) Topographic relief alone does not result in high rates of denudation. (3) Denudation rates are high in areas of landscape rejuvenation; that is triggered and controlled by tectonic activity (faulting, escarpment formation and retreat, rifting, surface uplift). (4) Rates of weathering (using a combination of cosmogenicnuclides and zirconium-normalised cation loss balances) co-vary primarily with physical erosion rates and much less with temperature or precipitation. (5) In some areas of high land use short-term rates (from river load gauging) exceed those from cosmogenicnuclides by several orders of magnitude, which serves to highlight the severity of geomorphic change caused by human action. In the future, the controlmechanisms over denudation will be determined on all spatial scales, ranging from the single soil section to entire riverbasins. The same analysis can be done back through time on well-dated terraces, lake records, and marine sediment cores, which is possible with 10Be for the past 1\textendash 2 My. The rates obtained will be used to develop a quantitative understanding of tectonic, geomorphologic, and geochemical landscape processes, which in turn is a prerequisite to design and calibrate models of the response of landscapes to tectonic, climate, and anthropogenic forcing.},
