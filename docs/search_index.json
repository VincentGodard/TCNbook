You can copy/paste the various lines of code into your own R script and run it in any R session. These activities do not require any specific prior knowledge of R programming language. The idea is for you to simply copy and paste the code in a script, run it, and change various parameters to observe and investigate the associated response. In addition to the scripting-oriented activities below you can also experiment visually with a few interactive Shiny apps http://shinyproxy.osupytheas.fr Both are built on the dedicated TCNtools package : https://vincentgodard.github.io/TCNtools This package contain various functions to assist the interpretation of TCN concentration at the Earth Surface. You can install the package directly on you system, using the instruction provided on the package webpage (requires devtools package to install from Github). Alternatively launch a binder session and get a RStudio session running into your browser with the TCNtools package installed. You can launch the binder by clicking on the icon ) on the package website (right column). The first thing we have to do, before calling any of these functions, is to load the TCNtools package. library(&quot;TCNtools&quot;) "],["introduction.html", "2 Introduction 2.1 Objectives of the session", " 2 Introduction 2.1 Objectives of the session We are going to cover two things during this session look into the calculation of scaling factors used for the computation of local production rates, and how they vary in space and time make some simple calculations of TCN concentration build up at the Earth surface, as a response to exposure and denudation test "],["scaling-factors.html", "3 Scaling factors 3.1 Time-independent scaling 3.2 Time-dependent scalings 3.3 Interactive App", " 3 Scaling factors First we are going to explore how the scaling factors are changing with elevation, latitude and time, and what is the impact on local production rates. 3.1 Time-independent scaling We are going to present the most widely used and simplest scaling scheme known as Lal-Stone and often abbreviated as st. The main equations are presented in the reference article by Stone (2000) . 3.1.1 Site characteristics We first need to define some parameters concerning the site of interest : latitude lat in degrees altitude z in meters (can be a vector or a scalar) longitude lon in degrees, this is not used for st scaling (Stone (2000)), just in case we want to compute atmospheric pressure according to ERA40 (Uppala et al. (2005)). lat = 30 # latitude lon = 30 # longitude z = seq(0,3000,by=100) # vector from 0 to 3000 m by 100 m increments Now we can compute the atmospheric pressure, with the function atm_pressure according to the two models available, and then plot for comparison. Here z is a vector to see the variations over a range of elevations. To get information about the usage of the function used here (for example what are the different models) type ?atm_pressure in the R console. P1 = atm_pressure(alt=z,model=&quot;stone2000&quot;) P2 = atm_pressure(alt=z,lat=lat,lon=lon,model=&quot;era40&quot;) plot(P1,z,type=&quot;l&quot;,xlab=&quot;Pressure (hPa)&quot;,ylab=&quot;Altitude (m)&quot;,col=&quot;darkorange3&quot;) lines(P2,z,lty=2,col=&quot;darkorange3&quot;) legend(&quot;topright&quot;,c(&quot;Stone 2000&quot;,&quot;ERA40&quot;),lty=c(1,2)) TODO Modify lat and lon to see the effects on the pressure computed with the ERA40 model 3.1.2 Computation of scaling factors We can now compute the scaling factors according to Stone (2000). Same as above, to get some information about the function (parameters definition) type ?st_scaling in the R console. st = scaling_st(P1,lat) # here we use the pressure according to Stone 2000 model print(st) ## Nneutrons Nmuons ## 1 0.8300224 0.8330000 ## 2 0.9026631 0.8751951 ## 3 0.9789258 0.9190924 ## 4 1.0593995 0.9647381 ## 5 1.1446610 1.0121787 ## 6 1.2352759 1.0614606 ## 7 1.3317993 1.1126307 ## 8 1.4347771 1.1657357 ## 9 1.5447466 1.2208226 ## 10 1.6622372 1.2779383 ## 11 1.7877718 1.3371297 ## 12 1.9218669 1.3984436 ## 13 2.0650339 1.4619266 ## 14 2.2177794 1.5276253 ## 15 2.3806062 1.5955858 ## 16 2.5540138 1.6658541 ## 17 2.7384989 1.7384759 ## 18 2.9345563 1.8134963 ## 19 3.1426788 1.8909602 ## 20 3.3633586 1.9709117 ## 21 3.5970868 2.0533946 ## 22 3.8443547 2.1384521 ## 23 4.1056535 2.2261264 ## 24 4.3814748 2.3164594 ## 25 4.6723113 2.4094921 ## 26 4.9786564 2.5052644 ## 27 5.3010052 2.6038156 ## 28 5.6398539 2.7051842 ## 29 5.9957004 2.8094072 ## 30 6.3690443 2.9165212 ## 31 6.7603872 3.0265612 The result is stored in st as a dataframe with as many rows as there are elements in the input pressure vector (P1) and two columns named Nneutrons and Nmuons, for the spallogenic and muogenic contributions, respectively. We can plot the evolution with elevation, which illustrates the major influence of altitude of the sampling site in controlling the local production rate. plot(st$Nneutrons,z,type=&quot;l&quot;, xlab=&quot;Spallogenic st scaling factor (Stone 2000)&quot;,ylab=&quot;Altitude (m)&quot;, main=paste(&quot;Latitude &quot;,lat,&quot;°&quot;,sep=&quot;&quot;),col=&quot;darkorange3&quot;) TODO Modify lat to see the effects on the scaling factor 3.1.3 Global variations In order to get a better idea of the variations with both latitude (from 0 to 90°) and elevation (from sea level to 3000 m) we can try the following plot. P = atm_pressure(alt=0,model=&quot;stone2000&quot;) # compute pressure lat = seq(0,90,by=1) # latitude vector n = length(lat) # size of vector st = scaling_st(P,lat) # compute scaling plot(lat,st$Nneutrons,type=&quot;l&quot;,ylim=c(0.5,12),col=&quot;darkorange3&quot;, xlab=&quot;Latitude (°)&quot;,ylab=&quot;Spallogenic st scaling factor (Stone 2000)&quot;) grid() text(lat[n],st$Nneutrons[n],&quot;0 km&quot;,cex=0.5,adj=0) # put label at the end of curve for (z in seq(500,3000,by=500)){ # loop on elevations : same as above for a range of elevations P = atm_pressure(alt=z,model=&quot;stone2000&quot;) st = scaling_st(P,lat) lines(lat,st$Nneutrons,col=&quot;darkorange3&quot;) text(lat[n],st$Nneutrons[n],z/1000,cex=0.5,adj=0) } This dependence of the scaling factor on latitude is a direct consequence of the dipole structure of the Earth magnetic field, with a higher cosmic rays flux at high latitudes. 3.2 Time-dependent scalings 3.2.1 Definition of paleomagnetic variations Time-dependent scaling factors allow to take into account the variations through time of the Earth magnetic field, which modulates the incoming cosmic ray flux. This is particularly important in exposure dating applications. 3.2.1.1 Virtual Dipole Moment We need to first define a time series for the Virtual Dipole Moment (VDM) variation, using the get_vdm function. Several paleomagnetic database can be used. The three options correspond to databases defined in Crep. We plot the three of them on the same graph. time = seq(0,50e3,length.out = 1000) # time vector from 0 to 50 ka BP, with 1000 regularly spaced elements # plot(NA,xlim=range(time),ylim=c(0,16),xlab=&quot;Time (a BP)&quot;,ylab=&quot;VDM (10^22 A.m^2)&quot;) grid() # - Glopis col1=&quot;coral1&quot; vdm1=get_vdm(time,model=&quot;glopis&quot;) lines(time,vdm1/1e22,col=col1) # 2 - Musch col2 = &quot;chartreuse&quot; vdm2=get_vdm(time,model=&quot;musch&quot;) lines(time,vdm2/1e22,col=col2) # 3 - lsd col3 = &quot;cornflowerblue&quot; vdm3=get_vdm(time,model=&quot;lsd&quot;) lines(time,vdm3/1e22,col=col3) legend(&quot;topright&quot;,c(&quot;glopis&quot;,&quot;musch&quot;,&quot;lsd&quot;),col=c(col1,col2,col3),lty=1) 3.2.1.2 Cutoff Rigidity Now we need to convert that into cutoff rigidity using vdm2rc function. Such can be done using the following expression (Martin et al. (2017)): \\[R_c = 14.3 \\frac{M}{M_0}\\cos^4 \\lambda,\\] where \\(M\\) is the moment of the Earth dipole field, \\(M_0\\) the 2010 reference value for \\(M\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) the latitude. This corresponds to the default model=elsasser54 in the vdm2rc function arguments. A more complex formula proposed by Lifton, Sato, and Dunai (2014) can be used with model=lifton14. lat = 40 rc1a = vdm2rc(vdm1,lat) rc1b = vdm2rc(vdm1,lat,model=&quot;lifton14&quot;) rc2a = vdm2rc(vdm2,lat) rc2b = vdm2rc(vdm2,lat,model=&quot;lifton14&quot;) rc3a = vdm2rc(vdm3,lat) rc3b = vdm2rc(vdm3,lat,model=&quot;lifton14&quot;) # plot(NA,xlim=range(time),ylim=range(rc1a,rc2a,na.omit(rc3a)),xlab=&quot;Time (a BP)&quot;,ylab=&quot;Rc (GV)&quot;) grid() lines(time,rc1a,col=col1) lines(time,rc1b,col=col1,lty=2) lines(time,rc2a,col=col2) lines(time,rc2b,col=col2,lty=2) lines(time,rc3a,col=col3) lines(time,rc3b,col=col3,lty=2) legend(&quot;bottomleft&quot;,c(&quot;glopis&quot;,&quot;musch&quot;,&quot;lsd&quot;,&quot;elsasser54&quot;,&quot;lifton14&quot;),col=c(col1,col2,col3,&quot;black&quot;,&quot;black&quot;),lty=c(1,1,1,1,2),cex=0.5) TODO change the latitude lat and observe the influence on \\(R_c\\) 3.2.2 Lal/Stone modified scaling (lm) Once we have a \\(R_c\\) time series we can compute the lm scaling factors using the scaling_lm function. For that we will only use one elevation (z=0), so we recompute the atmospheric pressure. We plot the corresponding time series, as well as the value of st scaling factor for reference. P = atm_pressure(alt=0,model=&quot;stone2000&quot;) lm = scaling_lm(P,rc1a) plot(time,lm,type=&quot;l&quot;,xlab=&quot;Time (a BP)&quot;,ylab=&quot;Spallogenic lm scaling factor&quot;) abline(h=scaling_st(P,lat)$Nneutrons,lty=2) TODO Explore the variations of the scaling factor by using various values for elevation alt, and different \\(R_c\\) time-series. Look for the differences with the time-independant st scaling 3.3 Interactive App You can also explore dynamically the behavior of scaling parameters using this embedded application, which use the same type of code. "],["exploring-tcn-build-up-at-the-surface.html", "4 Exploring TCN build up at the surface 4.1 Background 4.2 Set up of the calculations 4.3 Evolution of concentration with time 4.4 Two end-member situations", " 4 Exploring TCN build up at the surface We are going to consider simple computations of concentration under various conditions in terms of erosion, depth or age. This will be done using an Eulerian point of view, which is the most straightforward and fastest way to perform such computation. In this case the quantity of interest (concentration) is computed at fixed depths below the surface, while the exhumed material is moving through this reference frame during its trajectory toward the surface. More details on the differences between Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches, and their applications to complex exposition/denudation histories, will be studied later. Note that interpreting measured concentrations in terms of end-member situations of pure exposure or steady-state denudation is often done with online calculators (Balco et al. (2008),Marrero et al. (2016),Martin et al. (2017)). This will be fine in many cases, but you should always be careful about the underlying hypothesis (no erosion, steady state achieved…) when interpreting your concentrations and always think about how TCN are accumulating. The goal of this activity is to explore this behavior. 4.1 Background The relevant general equation is the following, \\[ C=C_0e^{-\\lambda t} + \\sum_i \\frac{P_i}{\\frac{\\rho \\varepsilon}{\\Lambda_i}+\\lambda}e^{\\frac{-\\rho z}{\\Lambda_i}}(1-e^{-(\\frac{\\rho \\varepsilon}{\\Lambda_i}+\\lambda)t}) \\] with the following variables and parameters, \\(C\\) the concentration (as a function of time \\(t\\) and depth \\(z\\)) \\(C_0\\) the inherited concentration \\(\\lambda\\) the decay constant for the considered nuclide \\(P_i\\) the scaled surface production rate for the nuclide of interest and the \\(i\\)-th production pathway (spallation, stopped muons, fast muons) \\(\\rho\\) the density of the medium \\(\\Lambda_i\\) the attenuation length for the particules of the \\(i\\)-th production pathway \\(\\varepsilon\\) surface denudation In order to stick with usual conventions in the following time \\(t\\) will be measured in years (a), the unit of length will be cm and the depths (\\(z\\)) will be expressed in g/cm\\(^2\\) (i.e. actual depth \\(\\times \\rho\\)). Note two keys limitations of this representation : it does not allow to account for time variations of production rates (at least in its most straightforward implementation), so we will mostly using the st scaling it assumes exponential evolution of production with depth, which is clearly not the case for low energy neutrons (figure 2b from Gosse and Phillips (2001)) and is questionable in some situations for muons (Balco (2017)) 4.2 Set up of the calculations We should the define the basic parameters we are going to use for the computation, which are two vectors : a vector with the attenuation lengths for different particles (in g/cm\\(^2\\)) neutrons for spallation reactions \\(\\Lambda_{spal}\\) stopping muons \\(\\Lambda_{stop}\\) fast muons \\(\\Lambda_{fast}\\) a vector (or matrix) with the SLHL production rates (in at/g/a), in this case for the st scaling scheme (Stone (2000)), and decay constant \\(\\lambda\\) (in 1/a) for the nuclide(s) of interest. For easy reference a set of data for these parameters is included in the TCNtools package, including Sea-Level High-Latitude production rates for the st scaling scheme. Note that these often used SLHL values are defined for convenience, most calculators for exposure age work directly with the production rate value at calibration sites, and that they are always relative to the scaling scheme used (Borchers et al. (2016)). We can first load the attenuation length data (g/cm\\(^2\\)). Documentation of this dataset is accessible with ?Lambda. data(Lambda) # we load a vector containing the attenuation length into the environment print(Lambda) ## Lspal Lstop Lfast ## 160 1500 4320 rho = 2.7 # we also define the density (g/cm3) Some production and decay parameters can also be loaded. Documentation of this dataset is accessible with ?prm. data(prm) # we load a matrix containing the production/decay parameters into the environment print(prm) ## Be10 Al26 C14 ## Pspal 4.01000e+00 2.793000e+01 1.224000e+01 ## Pstop 1.20000e-02 8.400000e-01 3.310000e+00 ## Pfast 3.90000e-02 8.100000e-02 0.000000e+00 ## lambda 5.09667e-07 9.667325e-07 1.209681e-04 We also need to define the properties of our site of interest and compute the relevant scaling parameters. As we already saw previously, this can easily be done with, altitude = 1000 # elevation in m latitude = 45 # latitude in degrees P = atm_pressure(alt=altitude,model=&quot;stone2000&quot;) # compute atmospheric pressure at site S = scaling_st(P,latitude) # compute the scaling parameters according to Stone (2000) 4.3 Evolution of concentration with time To get a general overview of the behavior we are going to use directly the solv_conc_eul function, which allows to easily deal with various configurations. In the following sections we will go back to the key equations to get a better sense of the importance of various parameters As always the documentation of the function, including its various arguments, can be obtained by typing ?solv_conc_eul in the R console. nuc = &quot;Be10&quot; # &quot;Al26&quot;, &quot;C14&quot; t = seq(0,200e3,length.out=1000) # a vector containing time from 0 to 100 ka by 100 a steps z = 0 * rho # depth at which we are going to perform the calculation (cm converted to g/cm2) C0 = 0 # inherited concentration (at/g) ero = 0 * (100/1e6*rho) # denudation rate expressed in m/Ma and converted in g/cm2/a C = solv_conc_eul(z,ero,t,C0,prm[,nuc],S,Lambda) # compute concentration plot(t/1000,C,type=&quot;l&quot;,col=&quot;cornflowerblue&quot;,lwd=3,ylab=&quot;Concentration (at/g)&quot;,xlab=&quot;Time (ka)&quot;) grid() # see explanation for these lines below Prod = c(prm[1,nuc]*S$Nneutrons,prm[2,nuc]*S$Nmuons,prm[3,nuc]*S$Nmuons) # scaled production vector (defined for the sake of clarity of the expressions below) lambda = prm[4,nuc] # radiactive decay abline(0,sum(Prod)*1000,lty=2) # note that time is in ka on the plot abline(h=sum(Prod/((ero/Lambda)+lambda)),lty=2) Start with zero erosion (\\(\\varepsilon=0\\)), corresponding to the pure exposition of a surface. We see here the progressive build-up of concentration though time and the establishment of balance between gains (production) and losses (denudation and decay) leading to the concentration plateau at steady state. Two lines are added to the graph, The first one corresponds to the production slope \\(\\sum_i P_i\\), how much nuclide you produce and how it would accumulate if you had no radioactive decay and no denudation. The second one (horizontal) is the maximum value of concentration when steady state is achieved : \\[ C_{max}=\\sum_i \\frac{P_i}{\\frac{\\rho \\varepsilon}{\\Lambda_i}+\\lambda} \\] TODO Change the maximum of the t vector until you see the influence of radioactive decay and the plateau. Add some inheritance Test the evolution with other nuclides (\\(^{26}\\)Al and \\(^{14}\\)C) You can also play around with this build up using this Shiny App : http://shinyproxy.osupytheas.fr/simple_accumulation Now try to modify the ero (always keeping it is in g/cm\\(^2\\)/a) parameter above, to see its influence on time needed to reach steady state and the final concentration. 4.4 Two end-member situations No we are going to build a summary plot showing the influence of both exposure and denudation. altitude = 1000 # elevation in m latitude = 45 # latitude in degrees nuc = &quot;Be10&quot; P = atm_pressure(alt=altitude,model=&quot;stone2000&quot;) # compute atmospheric pressure at site S = scaling_st(P,latitude) # compute the scaling parameters according to Stone (2000) t = 10^seq(log10(1),log10(10e6),length.out=1000) # time vector, log-spaced! # calculation of the evolution of concentration for denudation = 0 C = solv_conc_eul(0,0,t,0,prm[,nuc],S,Lambda) # compute concentration for pure exposure plot(t,C,type=&quot;l&quot;,col=&quot;cornflowerblue&quot;,lwd=3,ylab=&quot;Concentration (at/g)&quot;,xlab=&quot;Time (a)&quot;,log=&quot;xy&quot;) grid() text(max(t),max(C),0,cex=0.5,adj=0) # label the curve # now we make the same computation for other denudation rates ero = c(1,10,100,1000) # erosion vector in m/Ma for (i in 1:length(ero)){ e = ero[i] * (100/1e6*rho) # convert denudation in g/cm2/a C = solv_conc_eul(0,e,t,0,prm[,nuc],S,Lambda) # compute concentration for pure exposure lines(t,C,col=&quot;cornflowerblue&quot;,lwd=3) text(max(t),max(C),ero[i],cex=0.5,adj=0) # label the curve } Note that this a log-log plot. It is probably one of the most important figure to keep in mind when analyzing TCN concentrations. It clearly shows the existence of two end-member situations when interpreting these concentrations, in terms of exposure age or denudation rates, and the transition between the two. TODO Think about a bit about the following points What are the key hypothesis made when interpreting a TCN concentration in terms of exposure age surface denudation Can you think of geological/geomorphological situations where these hypotheses are violated? Why are the plateau concentrations so different? How is the time to reach the plateau changing and why?

It basically solving for \\(t\\) the equation \\(C_{mod}(t) = C_{mes}\\). The left hand side is our modelled concentration, obtained for example with ou simple Eulerian model (solv_conc_eul), where we need to keep in mind all the hypotheses we make (\\(z=0\\), \\(\\varepsilon=0\\), \\(C_0=0\\)) We are going to use an example from Protin et al.

The computation will be carried out at the surface (\\(z=0\\)), but this could be done at any arbitrary depth. We will consider that \\(t=+\\infty\\) and that we have reached the plateau concentration. The key equation is now, \\[C=\\sum_i \\frac{P_i}{\\frac{\\rho \\varepsilon}{\\Lambda_i}+\\lambda}\\] Which simplifies to \\(C\\approx\\frac{P_i \\Lambda_i}{\\rho \\varepsilon}\\) if we neglect radioactive decay.

Note the change in the relationship at very low denudation rates, which corresponds to the situation where the effects of radioactive decay become predominant. TODO Over what range of denudation rates it is reasonable to neglect radioactive decay? What kind of geological context could it correspond to?
