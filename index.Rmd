# Prerequisites

This html page is derived from an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook.
You can copy/paste the various lines of code into your own R script and run it in any R session.

These activities do not require any specific prior knowledge of R programming language.
The idea is for you to simply copy and paste the code in a script, run it, and change various parameters to observe and investigate the associated response.

In addition to the scripting-oriented activities below you can also experiment visually with a few interactive [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) apps

<http://shinyproxy.osupytheas.fr>

Both are built on the dedicated `TCNtools` package :

<https://vincentgodard.github.io/TCNtools>

This package contain various functions to assist the interpretation of TCN concentration at the Earth Surface.

You can install the package directly on you system (instructions on package website), or alternatively launch a binder session where everything is installed and should run smoothly.
You can launch the binder by clicking on the icon below, and access an online RStudio session in your browser.

[![binder](../data/binder.png)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/VincentGodard/TCNtools/main?urlpath=rstudio)

The first thing we have to do, before calling any of these functions, is to load the `TCNtools` package.

```{r}
library("TCNtools")
```
