# Introduction

## Objectives of the session

We are going to cover two things during this session

-   look into the calculation of scaling factors used for the computation of local production rates, and how they vary in space and time
-   make some simple calculations of TCN concentration build up at the Earth surface, as a response to exposure and denudation
